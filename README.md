1. I am a full stack Java developer with experience in Angular, SQL, Spring, Junit, and REST.
2. I also have experience using C# for game development using the Unity3D game engine. My inital experience with github was using it during game development. I original started learning to code through community college classes that focused on C++.
3. I enjoy working in Agile and taking a leadership role in development.
4. I originally received a degree in Music Theory/Music Composition. My original career aspiration was to be a video game composer. I left that field due to its competitive nature. I have used softwares like FMOD and created my own interactive systems in Unity3D which where how I became interested in code.
5. I also like working with 3D art and recently have been trying to lean HLSL (High Level Shader Language).
