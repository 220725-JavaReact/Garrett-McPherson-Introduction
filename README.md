2. I have experience using C# for game development using the Unity3D game engine. My inital experience with github was using it during game development.
3. I enjoy working in Agile and taking a leadership role in development.
4. I originally received a degree in Music Theory/Music Composition. My original career aspiration was to be a video game composer. I left that field due to its competitive nature.
5. I also like working with 3D art and recently have been trying to lean HLSL (High Level Shader Language).
